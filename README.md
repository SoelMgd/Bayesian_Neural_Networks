# Bayesian Neural Network Posterior Analysis with HMC

This project replicates and extends the work of [Wenzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03285) on Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for posterior inference. We aim to assess the performance and convergence properties of HMC applied to deep learning models.

## Key Features:
- Replication of experiments from [Wenzel et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03285) with reduced resources, in pytorch
- Implementation of HMC for Bayesian inference in neural networks
- Experiments on MNIST dataset, posterior temperature, prior variance, chains mixing etc.
